# Brainfuck in Various Programming Languages

Welcome to the "Brainfuck in Various Programming Languages" repository! In this repository, you'll find implementations of the Brainfuck programming language in various languages. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic and challenging syntax.

## What is Brainfuck?

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller. It is known for its minimalist design, consisting of only eight commands:

- `>`: Increment the memory pointer.
- `<`: Decrement the memory pointer.
- `+`: Increment the byte at the memory pointer.
- `-`: Decrement the byte at the memory pointer.
- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the memory pointer is zero.
- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the memory pointer is nonzero.
- `.`: Output the byte at the memory pointer as an ASCII character.
- `,`: Accept one input byte, storing its value in the byte at the memory pointer.

Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The goal of Brainfuck is to manipulate the memory cells to produce a desired output.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language. Each language has its own directory containing an implementation of the Brainfuck interpreter/compiler in that language. You can explore the various implementations by navigating to the respective directories.

Here's a list of programming languages currently included:

- [Python](py/)
- [C++](cpp/) (Coming soon)
- [Java](java/)
- [c#](cs/) (Coming soon)
- more (Coming soon)

## Python Implementation

You can find the Brainfuck interpreter written in Python [here](python/). This implementation allows you to run Brainfuck code using Python.

🐍 **Python Implementation Highlights:**

- The interpreter uses a list as the memory tape.
- The eight Brainfuck commands are implemented as functions.
- A loop stack is used to keep track of loop positions.
